## Entry Points for Contributors

**Start anywhere. Fork freely. No permission needed.**

### Story Entry Points

- Write a scene where a modern urban space (a subway station, a parking garage, a server farm) 'speaks' a forgotten Indigenous name or story through a glitch or anomaly.
- Create a character profile for 'The Drowned Woman'—not as a ghost, but as a geological and historical record of the land itself.
- Draft a 'counter-map' of a familiar city neighborhood, labeling it not with streets but with events, memories, and ecological features erased by development.
- Write a dialogue between a pragmatic city planner and a character who perceives the spiritual history of the land they are surveying.

### Technical Entry Points

- Build an interactive web map that layers historical Indigenous place names and stories over a modern street grid, allowing users to toggle between 'official' and 'memory' cartographies.
- Create a text-based game where the player uses 'listening' and 'remembering' as primary mechanics to solve puzzles and navigate a hostile, haunted cityscape.
